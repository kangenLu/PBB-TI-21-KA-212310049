    <h1 style="color:rgb(155, 155, 240);"> A Brief History of Vodka </h1>
    <p>Vodka is a traditional alcoholic drink distilled from fermented grains or potatoes. Sometimes some flavors are added. It is a clear, colorless drink and can be mixed with other drinks.The word Vodka is derived from the Slavic word Voda, meaning<span style= "color:rgb(97, 116, 210);"> “water”</span> then K was added and it became Vodka.</p>

    <p>It is hard to define a precise date of the beginning of vodka manufacture because of the lack of written resources. However, vodka originated in Eastern Europe. The first production of vodka was probably in Poland in the 8th century and in another area in Russia dating back to the 9th century based on various sources.According to Gin and Vodka Association (GVA), the first document distillation of vodka was 300 years ago in Khynovsk. However, vodka at that time was quite different in comparison to today’s vodka. The vodka of that time had different taste, color and odor, was originally used as a drug and contained little alcohol (about<span style="color: rgb(231, 131, 148);">14%</span>) that can be obtained through natural fermentation.</p>
    
    <p>Poland</p>In Poland, vodka was produced since the beginning of middle ages as a varied local tradition, like cognac in France or whisky in Scotland. The first written document mentioning the use of word <span style="color: rgb(239, 109, 58);">“vodka”</span> in Poland dates back to 1405 AD as it was a famous drink then. It was also used as a medical and cosmetic compound. The word “vodka” also appeared in 1533 AD as a medical compound brought from Poland to Russia by merchants. In Potanski’s book in 1614 AD, he talked about vodka and stressed its value and method of production. Krakov also wrote in his book in 1693 AD about the method of making vodka from rye grains in detail.</p>
    
    <p>Russia</p>In 1386, the Genoa ambassadors brought what was called <span style="color: rgb(82, 0, 245);">“life elixir”</span>  or “water of life” to Moscow. This liquid was obtained through distilling grapes. According to the myth, in 1430, there was a priest called Isidore from Chudov monastery inside the Kremlin in Moscow who made the first Russian vodka recipe. He had the tools and knowledgeready for distillation, and he became the innovator of the highest-quality alcoholic drinks. At that time, vodka was called bread wine and its production was limited for a long time to Moscow and not any other empire.</p>
    
    <p>Sweden</p>Until 1950, vodka had not been used as a Swedish distilled drink, and it had been called instead Brännwin, meaning “burnt wine,” which is the basis of the word <span style="color: rgb(2, 108, 51);"> “brandy.”</span> These drinks were produced in Sweden in the late 15th century although the gross production was still small until the 17th century. In the early 18th century, production was extended even though drinks were banned several times due to the lack of grains. Thus, potato was used and prevailed in the early 19th century. Gradually from 1960, the unflavored Swedish Brännwin was called vodka. The first Swedish product that used this name was Explorer Vodka that was made in 1958. The goal was in the beginning to export it to the US markets. In 1979, Absolut Vodka brand was launched. Vodka became a popular drink among the youth with the existence of a flourishing black market.</p>
